if distributing, add the contents of "addToWorkingDir" to the directory of the executable.

Controls:
Space - save island
Enter - load island, .csv file must be in working dir, enter island name in the console
0-9 - load palette with that name from /gfx/

How to use:
left click a tile from your palette on the left to start drawing with it
water tiles (top left tile in palette) are written as 0, so not drawn when loaded in game
